title": Comparing Vue Component Libraries

draft: true
---

Rather than coding and styling buttons, cards, and layouts, you can use these libraries to get access to all the necessary UI elements for creating beautiful, content-rich applications.

## Why component libraries are good and when to use them

Component libraries provide a good base to get into building application layout and pages rather than focusing on the small details of how a button should work.

- Lots of work done for you
- Sharing updates and the work load with a community of people

## The bad and when not to use them

- Component libraries are large
- Third party dependency
  - Can be slow to update or fix
  - If something breaks you need to jump into the code to fix it
- Don't work the way you want all the time.
- Don't integrate with other third party components.

## Attributes to look at when comparing component libraries

- Tree shaking
- Accessibility (a11y)
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Integration with existing tooling
- Number of components
- Component performance impact
