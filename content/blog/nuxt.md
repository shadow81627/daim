### Static Site Generation

Static Site Generation is a hot topic right now (aka [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/)). Instead of switching to another framework and spending time getting used to it, you can meet all your needs with one framework?

Nuxt.js supports generating a static website based on your Vue application. It's the "best of both worlds" as you don't need a server but still have SEO benefits because Nuxt will pre-render all pages and include the necessary HTML. Also, you can deploy the resulting pages to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Performance

You get optimized applications out of the box. We do our best to build performant applications by utilizing Vue.js and Node.js best practices. Squeezing every unnecessary bit out of your app Nuxt includes a bundle analyzer and lots of opportunities to fine-tune your app.

### Modular

You can choose from more than [50 awesome modules](https://github.com/nuxt-community/awesome-nuxt) to make your development faster and easier. You don't have to there is no need to fiddle around setting up service workers to get [PWA](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/) benefits, add [Google Analytics](https://github.com/nuxt-community/analytics-module) to your page or generate a [sitemap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/sitemap).

### Developer Experience

We love Nuxt.js and continuously improve the framework so you love it too! Appealing solutions, descriptive error messages, powerful defaults and detailed [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide). If questions or problems come up, our helpful community will help you out.

## Getting Started

---

Following the Nuxt [installation guide](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation):

The Nuxt.js team has created a scaffolding tool called create-nuxt-app to help get you started.

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>
```

It will ask you some questions (name, Nuxt options, UI framework (Vuetify), TypeScript, linter (Eslint, Prettier), testing framework, modules(nuxt content), etc.), when answered, it will install all the dependencies so the next step is to navigate to the project folder and launch it with:

```bash
cd <project-name>
npm run dev
```

The application is now running on <http://localhost:3000>.
