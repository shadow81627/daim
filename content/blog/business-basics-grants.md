## About the Program

The Queensland Government provides specific support for the small business sector through
the [Big Plans for Small Business Strategy](https://desbt.qld.gov.au/small-business/strategic-documents/small-business-strategy). The Business Basics grants program (Program) provides support to businesses to **increase core skills** and **adopt best practice**.
The Program is competitive, meaning that applications are competitively assessed against the
assessment criteria and not all applications get funded.

The Department of Employment, Small Business and Training (DESBT) manage the grants.

Applicants can apply for funding for grant funded activities in one of five **priorities**:

1. Training and coaching
2. Website build/upgrades
3. Professional business advice
4. Strategic marketing services
5. Business continuity and succession

## Program outcomes

The expected outcomes of the grants program are to:

- increase confidence for business owners across core skills;
- boost turnover, profit, and employment; and
- improve business survivability and resilience.

## What funding is available?

There are two funding streams based on what Local Government Area (LGA) eligible businesses are headquartered. These LGAs are grouped into either South East Queensland or regional Queensland. If successful, applicants will receive upfront fixed grant funding of **$5,000** (excluding GST). Successful applicants don't have to co-contribute to this grant; successful applicants must pay for any related expenses in excess of the $5,000 grant funding.

## What is an acceptable supplier quote?

- Supplier name - as appears on the corresponding quote.
- Information - any helpful details of the quote.

Where possible, quotations must be a formal quote on business letterhead.
