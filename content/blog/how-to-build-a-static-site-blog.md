## Introduction

Have you ever tried to set up a personal blog? If so, you'll know that it's difficult because there are so many blogging platforms and tools to choose from. So what do you do? Many people have found success by using Wordpress. But there are a few things you should know before you buy and implement a your personal blog to ensure good SEO and an easy content management experience. This post will tell you what you need to know to make sure you build the best personal blog that will let you successfully share your great ideas with the internet.

## Features

If you're looking to build a static site blog, the best method to ensure you end up with something that lets you express yourself is by looking for these things:

Make sure your blogging platform has the flexibility to style content your way. If it doesn't, you'll have trouble making things look just the way you like them. [Nuxt Content Module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) allows the use of Vue components inside of markdown files. This is a super powerful feature for injecting rich content like maps and other fancy visuals.

Ensure your blog has an image manager so you can upload hero images to use as the og:image. I use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to dynamically resize and optimize images so they load super fast. Web pages load a lot faster when images are served in optimised formats like webp. A good hero image is critical for making blog posts look interesting when shared on social media.

Any good content manager should let you use markdown. This is important because you need to be able to insert links and other rich content styling like bold and italic text without having to use a wysiwyg editor. I use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to edit my blog posts since it is free, open source, and self hosted.

While not necessary, some great bonus features of a great static site blog are free hosting, open source, and perfomance. I host my personal site on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) since the free teir is super generous compared to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I am able to run all the builds I need for rapid prototyping, bandwidth is unlimited, the builds are fast with caching, and the CDN is super fast serving content in under 50ms.

## Conclusion

Now that you know how to build a static site blog with Nuxt, you're ready to share your awesome content with the internet without worrying about hosting and maintaining a Wordpress server.
