        <h2>1. The problem</h2>
        <strong>What problem are you trying to solve?</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm looking for a all in one back office solution that will help me
          manage my business. As a Tech entrepreneur I want to automate the
          boring bits of starting a new project.
        </p>
        <p>
          When writing code there is a code principle called Don't Repeat
          Yourself(DRY). As soon as I need to use something a second time I make
          it reusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked in digital agencies delivering public facing marketing
          websites for over 5 years, across a range of industries. Every project
          had a large amount of boring boilerplate that is always the same or
          slightly different.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to have the developer experience of writing minimal code that
          gives maximal results. I love open source and the community of sharing
          and improving on common projects. I like to build on the shoulders of
          giants.
        </p>
        <p>
          I struggle to work with systems like wordpress since the code backing
          them is really ugly, hard to logically organise and edit. Writing
          custom code each time for a project is unsustainable because I now
          have 10 slightly different version of the same code.

        <p>
          I want to make software affordable and sustainable. I need to balance
          paying developers for their time and effort with the cost of the
          product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open source developes write code for pure passion, but often get burnt
          out. I want to make sure open source developers can keep working on
          the projects that support my product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small business can't afford to pay much for software they are usually
          bootstrapping with their own hard earned cash. Providing best in class
          software at an affordable price to start ups will allow them to focus
          on their business without having to worry about the technology.

          I'm an experienced developer with a passion for making amazing

          the client.

          I love change, thats why I'm a JavaScript developer. The iterative
          process of improvement is a fun journey and can lead to quick
          innovative solutions.

        <strong>Conservative, calculated, or aggressive?</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm a cowboy and like to take on risk. I don't like to play within the
          rules. I think outside the box and usually end up curb stomping the
          box. I've been described as a knife without a handle by project
          managers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also understand that project stakeholders have their own risk
          tolerance and tailor my work to meet those expectations. I don't want
          to disappoint anyone and do my best to communicate the risk level that
          is acceptable for both of us.
        </p>

          Break the rules, not the law, but break the rules. It is impossible to
          be a maverick or a true original if you're too well behaved and don't
          want to break the rules. You have to think outside the box.

          Every organisation needs a website in the information age, it forms

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          There are many Content Management Systems and back office app software
          out there. There are also plenty of freelancers and digital agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is still plenty of demand for the services of a developer in the
          current market there are 2 jobs for every developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to compete on all aspects of the product and service I provide.
          I'm very ambitious in what I want to provide. I want to generally
          better than the rest. I want to learn from them, what works best and
          what doesn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to build the product for myself to use and if other people like
          it thats a bonus.

          Re-platforming an existing website can be a hard task to convince
          people to part with their money on. Other times people want to refresh
          the brand and start fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be nice to come in as a do it for you type digital agency
          that can make a small business website quickly that just works for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a website is built they are almost a set and forget and don't get
          updated much. Making it easy for the client to update the website is a
          good way to keep the website fresh and active.
